# Introduction to Assessing Network Vulnerabilities

Many organizations don’t have a well-defined security policy.  
Others have policies but they are poorly written or no one follows them because there are no consequences built into the policy.

> Security is a **process**

## Process for Assessing Risk

1. **Risk Analysis** should be performed to establish the security state of the system.  
   - This helps find the security problems at the first stage.
2. **Risk Analysis** should be performed whenever changes are made to systems, processes, or programs.
3. **Vulnerability Assessment** should be performed periodically to examine the controls that have been implemented.

> A primary reason to do **Risk Assessment**: due **care** and due **diligence**

## Four Ways in Which You Can Respond to Risk

1. **Avoidance**  
   Taking steps to change your plan, go with different technology, or hire employees skilled in dealing with the problem you’re facing.
2. **Transferring**  
   Moving the ownership of risk to a third party.  
   _Example: insurance is one way to transfer the risk._
3. **Mitigation**  
   Actively reducing the effect of the risk even before it happens.  
   _Example: adding security features in software, spending more time at the development stage._
4. **Acceptance**  
   Accepting the risk when no other options are available, or when the potential loss is small compared with the project benefit.

## Network Vulnerability Assessment

The **network vulnerability assessment** is a tool that looks at the existing security program and analyzes it to see if it meets the organization’s needs.

### Types of Network Vulnerability Assessment

1. **Policy Assessments**  
   A top-down look at the organization’s policies, procedures, and guidelines.  
   The purpose of policy assessment is to answer three questions:
   - Do the applicable policies exist?
   - Are they being followed?
   - Is the content sufficient to guard against potential risk?

2. **Network Evaluations**  
   Includes all the elements of a level I assessment plus hands-on activities.  
   Hands-on activities include:
   - Information gathering
   - Vulnerability assessment scanning
   - Other technical testing

3. **Penetration Tests**  
   Takes on an adversarial role to see what an outsider can access and control.
