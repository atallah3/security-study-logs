# Why Risk Assessment 
Recent laws and mandates in the U.S. and Canada require organizations across industries to conduct **vulnerability and risk assessments**. Key regulations include:

- **HIPAA** – for healthcare institutions
- **GLBA** – for U.S. banks and financial institutions
- **FISMA** – for U.S. federal agencies
- **Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)** – for publicly traded U.S. companies with market cap > $75M
- **MITS (Canada)** – for Canadian federal agencies

These mandates push organizations to be **security-conscious**, requiring them to:

1. Identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in IT systems.
2. Assess risks based on the importance of affected assets.
3. Implement appropriate security controls to reduce risk.

# **Risk Terminology**

> In IT security, **risk** relates to the likelihood that a threat will exploit a weakness and impact valuable assets.

It involves three key elements:

- **Asset** – something of value to the organization (e.g., data, IT components).
- **Threat** – a circumstance that could cause harm or damage to an asset.
- **Vulnerability** – a weakness in the IT infrastructure that a threat can exploit.

Together, these define the core relationship between **risk, threats, and vulnerabilities** in information security.

## **IT assets**

 **IT assets** (or **data assets**) are items of value financial or operational that organizations must protect. Examples include:

- **Workstations:** PCs, phones, and end-user devices with data/software.
- **Operating systems:** OS software, patches, and configurations.
- **Application software:** Databases, client/server apps, and updates.
- **LAN infrastructure:** Switches, routers, TCP/IP, and related software.
- **WAN infrastructure:** Routers, WAN equipment, and software.
- **Network management systems:** SNMP tools, monitoring servers, and related data.
- **Telecommunications:** PBX, IP telephony, voicemail, and desktop phone devices.
- **IT security systems:** Firewalls, IDS/IPS, DMZ servers, and monitoring systems.
- **Servers and applications:**  OS, apps, production servers, and code/IP.
- **Intellectual property:** Customer data, application data, and proprietary information.
- **Documentation & backups:** Configuration records, backup files, and archives.

## **Threat**

A **threat** is any condition, agent, or event that could harm an IT or data asset by affecting its **confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA)**. Threats can lead to data loss, modification, disclosure, or service denial.

**Examples of IT infrastructure threats include:**

- **Unauthorized access:** Compromised credentials granting illegal entry.
- **Data loss/damage/modification:** Missing or corrupted data, especially if not backed up.
- **Disclosure of confidential information:** Leaks that cause financial, legal, or competitive harm.
- **Hacker attacks:** Intentional exploitation of systems and data.
- **Cyber terrorism:** Targeting critical infrastructure (energy, water, nuclear, etc.).
- **Viruses and malware:** Malicious code (viruses, worms, Trojans) that damages systems.
- **Denial of service (DoS/DDoS):** Flooding networks/hosts to disrupt availability.
- **Natural disasters (Acts of God):** Fires, floods, storms, earthquakes destroying infrastructure.

## **Vulnerability**

A **vulnerability** is a weakness in system design, procedures, or software/code that could be exploited by a threat. Vulnerabilities are common in IT systems since no software is completely free of flaws. They can be reduced through **safeguards and countermeasures**.

**Common sources of vulnerabilities include:**

- **Firmware:** Code stored in ROM, loaded at startup.
- **Operating systems:** Software running on workstations and servers.
- **Configuration files:** Device setup and configuration settings.
- **Application software:** Executable files and programs used by users.
- **Software patches:** Updates meant to fix bugs but can themselves introduce weaknesses.

## **Problem in IT security**

The **core problem in IT security** is that:

- **Software always has vulnerabilities.**
- **Hackers know about them.**
- **Organizations try to patch them—but often too late.**

Achieving a **zero-day vulnerability window** (no time between discovery and patching) is unrealistic because:

1. Vendors cannot release patches immediately.
2. Organizations need time to test, deploy, and install patches.
3. During this window, IT systems remain exposed to threats.

> Because most IT assets (firmware, OS, configurations, applications) depend on software, organizations must have a **software maintenance and patch management plan**. Large enterprises especially need **automated patch-management solutions** to stay secure.

---

### **The Vulnerability Window Problem**

- A **vulnerability window** is the time between when a vulnerability is discovered and published (**VTopen**) and when the patch is installed on systems (**VTclosed**).
- Formula: **Vulnerable Time (Vt) = VTopen – VTclosed**
- IT assets are most at risk during this period.
- Example: **SQL Slammer (2003)** exploited a Microsoft SQL vulnerability disclosed in July 2002 but left unpatched on many systems—impacting ~90% of SQL databases six months later.

### **Stages of Vulnerability**

1. Vendor releases software (with unknown flaws).
2. Vulnerability is discovered, documented, and published (**vulnerability window is open** **VTopen**).
3. Vendor develops and releases a patch.
4. Patch becomes available to users.
5. Patch is installed, closing the vulnerability window (**vulnerability window is closed VTclosed**).

---

### **Organizational Response**

- First-time vulnerability assessments often shock organizations, revealing many unpatched systems.
- **Goal**: Reduce vulnerability time on mission-critical IT assets.
- Many organizations adopt **policies** defining the maximum acceptable vulnerability exposure for production systems.
- **Patch-management solutions** (especially automated, enterprise-level) are essential.
- Policies must prioritize **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)** of critical assets.

---

### **Best Practice**

1. Build an **IT asset inventory** (hardware, firmware, OS, applications, patch versions).
2. Cross-check assets against the **CVE list** to identify known vulnerabilities.
3. Assess whether each vulnerable asset’s **value and criticality** require remediation.

## **Risk Assessment Best Practices**

Risk and vulnerability assessments help organizations understand the security posture of their IT infrastructure and assets, identify weaknesses, and provide recommendations for improvement. To conduct them effectively, organizations should follow structured best practices:

1. **Create a Risk Assessment Policy**
    - Defines how often assessments must be done (often annually),
    - How risks are addressed and mitigated (e.g., acceptable vulnerability windows),
    - Provides a standard approach for future assessments.
2. **Inventory IT Infrastructure and Assets**
    - Critical first step: compile a full database of hardware, software, data, and systems.
    - Without this, asset valuation and prioritization cannot be done.
3. **Define Goals and Objectives Aligned with Business Drivers**
    - Ensures the assessment supports business priorities.
    - Helps focus on critical assets first, especially under budget constraints.
4. **Select a Consistent Methodology and Approach**
    - Methodology depends on accurate asset identification, criticality evaluation, and decision-making style of the organization.
5. **Conduct Asset Valuation / Criticality Assessment**
    - Determine asset importance based on cost, business value, or operational necessity.
    - Prioritize assets that are most critical to operations.
6. **Define and Limit Scope**
    - Many organizations have limited budgets.
    - Prioritize mission-critical assets while applying defense-in-depth for broader coverage.
7. **Evaluate Risks, Threats, and Vulnerabilities**
    - Map identified risks to prioritized assets.
    - Supports informed decision-making.
8. **Establish a Standard Measurement for Asset Categorization**
    - Classify assets as *Critical, Major, or Minor*.
    - Based on laws, business importance, or monetary value.
9. **Perform Assessment Using Defined Standards**
    - Align risk and vulnerability assessments with the organization’s priorities and compliance requirements.
10. **Prepare Final Assessment Report**
    - Summarize goals, findings, gap analysis, and recommendations.
    - Provides a roadmap for management decisions.
11. **Prioritize, Budget, and Implement Recommendations**
    - Tactical (short-term fixes) and strategic (long-term improvements) recommendations must be planned and funded.
    - Implementation may take months or years.
12. **Implement Ongoing Security Awareness & Training**
    - All employees must be trained on security best practices.
    - Reduces human-related vulnerabilities.

## **Understanding the IT Security Process**

Security is tied to the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Attacks on IT assets can cause:

- **Availability risks:** downtime leads to loss of productivity, financial loss, SLA violations, and in some cases, even loss of life.
- **Integrity risks:** unauthorized access and modification/destruction of data compromise trust.
- **Confidentiality risks:** exposure of sensitive data (e.g., financial, health, or intellectual property), potentially leading to identity theft and regulatory violations (HIPAA, GLBA).

### **Security in the Development Life Cycle**

Security must be built into IT systems and applications from the start—not as an afterthought.

Steps include:

1. **Risk/Threat/Vulnerability Analysis** – before requirements are defined.
2. **System Requirements Definition and Design** – embed security requirements into technical needs.
3. **Functional Design** – ensure security is part of system functionality.
4. **Security Design** – implement security measures based on requirements.
5. **Test Plan** – verify technical, functional, and security aspects.
6. **Validation/Verification** – confirm requirements and security were met.

> By integrating security into the system development life cycle (SDLC), organizations minimize risks and reduce costly fixes later.

# **Goals and Objectives of a Risk Assessment**

Organizations perform risk and vulnerability assessments for different reasons—sometimes to comply with laws/regulations, and often to establish prevention, detection, and response mechanisms within their IT security processes.

### **Security Process Definition**

Security as a process involves **three key elements**:

1. **Prevention**
    - Security controls and safeguards are designed into systems/applications from the start.
    - Easier to protect **availability, integrity, confidentiality (AIC)** when built into design.
2. **Detection (Monitoring)**
    - Ongoing monitoring of log files, audit trails, IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems), and vulnerability reports.
    - Continuous effort by IT security professionals to track new risks and threats.
3. **Response**
    - Organizational actions taken when breaches/incidents occur.
    - Usually supported by:
        - **Business Continuity Plan (BCP):** Ensures operations continue after loss of critical assets.
        - **Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):** Restores IT infrastructure after disasters (e.g., fire, flood, war).
        - **Security Incident Response Team (SIRT):** Cross-functional team that investigates incidents, maintains confidentiality, and ensures forensic integrity.
        - **Forensic Analysis Plan:** Ensures collected evidence is admissible in court by following strict procedures.

### **Common Goals and Objectives of Risk & Vulnerability Assessments**

- Maintain an **accurate inventory** of IT/data assets.
- **Prioritize assets** based on monetary value, importance, or criticality.
- Identify and document **risks, threats, vulnerabilities**.
- Prioritize vulnerabilities by **impact** or **asset criticality**.
- Identify and **minimize vulnerability windows** to acceptable tolerance levels.
- Budget and plan **remediation/mitigation** efforts properly.
- Ensure **compliance** with laws, mandates, and regulations.
- Identify **gaps in IT security architecture** and recommend solutions.
- Justify the **cost of security investments** to management.
- Provide an **objective assessment** aligned with organizational goals.
- Help determine **ROI** for IT security investments.
